[INSTRUCTIONS]

==Install NMS font==
Simply right-click "geonms-font.ttf" and click "Install". If you only want to use the NMS font as a typefont (i.e. as a font choice in word processors), this is all you needed to do. Only perform the following steps if you want to use the NMS font for system text (program header bars, taskbar clock, menus, etc).

==Change system font to NMS==
NOTE: Font will only be changed where the system default font is used. Text for the Windows 10 lock screen, web pages, etc. will not be changed as their font settings cannot be accessed by these scripts.

1. Close all open programs.

2. Double-click "NMSFont.reg".

3. Grant admin authorization if Windows asks for it.

4. Windows should warn you that registry files will be modified; as long as you are following these instructions you may click "Yes" to allow the changes.

5. Restart your computer.

6. Confirm the system default font has changed by opening File Explorer.

==Change system font back to default==
1. Close all open programs.

2. Double-click "RevertToDefault.reg".

3. Grant admin authorization if Windows asks for it.

4. Windows should warn you that registry files will be modified; as long as you are following these instructions you may click "Yes" to allow the changes.

5. Restart your computer.

6. Confirm the system default font has changed by opening File Explorer.
